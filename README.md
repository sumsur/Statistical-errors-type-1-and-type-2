# Statistical-errors-type-1-and-type-2
In statistical theory, the notion of a statistical error is an integral part of hypothesis testing. 
The test goes about choosing about two competing propositions called null hypothesis, denoted by H0 and alternative hypothesis, 
denoted by H1. The null hypothesis corresponds to the position of some value of mean of random data: for example, we predict that mean 
will be some ordinary value. The null hypothesis presumed to be true until the data provide convincing evidence against it. 
The alternative hypothesis corresponds to the some different value of mean.  If the result of the test corresponds with reality, 
then a correct decision has been made. However, if the result of the test does not correspond with reality, then an error has occurred. 
There are two situations in which the decision is wrong. The null hypothesis may be true, whereas we reject H0. On the other hand, 
the alternative hypothesis H1 may be true, whereas we do not reject H0. Two types of error are distinguished: 
Type I error and type II error.  

Type I error  
The first kind of error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis as the result of a test procedure. 
This kind of error is called a type I error and is sometimes called an error of the first kind.  

Type II error  
The second kind of error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis as the result of a test procedure. 
This sort of error is called a type II error and is also referred to as an error of the second kind.
